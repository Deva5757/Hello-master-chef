                        <h3>Information</h3>
                        <p>Biryani is a popular rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent and is now enjoyed
                            around the world. It is made with long-grain rice, meat (typically chicken, beef, or lamb),
                            and a variety of spices, herbs, and vegetables.</p>
                        <p>The exact origin of biryani is not clear, but it is believed to have originated in the Indian
                            subcontinent and spread to other parts of the world through trade and migration. Biryani has
                            evolved over time, and different regions have developed their own unique styles and
                            variations.</p>
                        <p>The basic recipe for biryani involves cooking rice and meat separately and then combining
                            them with a blend of spices, such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala.
                            Vegetables like onions, tomatoes, and potatoes may also be added to the dish. The biryani is
                            then baked or steamed, allowing the flavors to blend together.</p>
                        <p>Biryani is often served with raita, a yogurt-based condiment, and a side of pickles. It is a
                            popular dish for special occasions and celebrations, as well as everyday meals.</p>
                        <p>There are many different types of biryani, each with its own unique flavor and style. For
                            example, Hyderabadi biryani is a popular variation from the southern Indian city of
                            Hyderabad, and is known for its spicy flavor and use of saffron. Lucknowi biryani from the
                            northern Indian city of Lucknow is known for its delicate flavor and use of aromatic spices.
                        </p>
                        <p>Overall, biryani is a delicious and flavorful dish that has become a staple of Indian and
                            Pakistani cuisine, and is now enjoyed by people all over the world.</p>

                            <p>The earliest records of North Indian cuisine date back to the Vedic period (1500 BCE –
                                500 BCE), where food was considered a sacred offering to the gods. The Vedic texts
                                mention a variety of foods such as rice, lentils, barley, and vegetables. The Mauryan
                                Empire (322 BCE – 185 BCE) saw the introduction of spices like cumin, coriander, and
                                turmeric, which were used in Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
                                <p>During the medieval period, North India saw the rise of the Mughal Empire (1526 – 1857),
                                which brought with it a rich culinary tradition. Mughlai cuisine, which is characterized
                                by the use of rich spices, nuts, and dairy products, originated in the royal kitchens of
                                the Mughal emperors. Some of the iconic dishes of Mughlai cuisine include biryani,
                                kebabs, and butter chicken.</p>
                                <p>In addition to the Mughals, North India also saw the influence of the British, who
                                introduced new ingredients and cooking techniques. The British influence can be seen in
                                dishes such as chicken tikka masala, which is said to have originated in the UK.</p>
                                <p>Today, North Indian cuisine is a fusion of different culinary traditions and has a wide
                                variety of dishes that cater to different tastes and preferences. Some of the popular
                                North Indian dishes include dal makhani, chole bhature, paneer tikka, and tandoori
                                chicken.</p>

                                and lentils in various forms. The cuisine of South India has a long and rich history,
                                with influences from various regions and cultures.</p>
                                <p>The early history of South Indian cuisine dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization
                                (3300 BCE – 1300 BCE), where rice, lentils, and millet were staple foods. The Chola
                                Dynasty (300 BCE – 1279 CE) played a significant role in shaping the cuisine of South
                                India by introducing new ingredients like coconut and tamarind.</p>
                                <p>During the medieval period, the Vijayanagara Empire (1336 – 1646 CE) brought a fusion of
                                different culinary traditions from different parts of India, resulting in the creation
                                of new and unique dishes. The Maratha Empire (1674 – 1818 CE) also contributed to the
                                cuisine of South India by introducing new ingredients like eggplants, tomatoes, and
                                potatoes.</p>
                                <p>South Indian cuisine is known for its extensive use of rice and lentils, which are used
                                to prepare a variety of dishes such as dosa, idli, and vada. These dishes are typically
                                served with sambar, a lentil-based vegetable stew, and chutneys made with coconut,
                                tomato, or mint.</p>

                                206 BCE) saw the introduction of new ingredients such as soybeans, which led to the
                                development of new dishes like tofu and soy sauce.</p>
                            <p>During the Tang Dynasty (618 CE – 907 CE), Chinese cuisine flourished, and new cooking
                                techniques such as stir-frying and deep-frying were introduced. The Song Dynasty (960 CE
                                – 1279 CE) saw the emergence of regional cuisines, with dishes like dim sum and hot pot
                                becoming popular in the southern regions of China.</p>
                            <p>Today, Chinese cuisine is divided into eight distinct regional cuisines, each with its
